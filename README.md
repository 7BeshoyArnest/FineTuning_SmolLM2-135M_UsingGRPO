Fine-Tuning SmolLM2-135M Using GRPO

🚀 Fine-tuning a lightweight Large Language Model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), LoRA, and deploying it with FastAPI & Streamlit

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates fine-tuning the SmolLM2-135M-Instruct model using GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) from the trl library, combined with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for parameter-efficient training.

The fine-tuned model is deployed as:

FastAPI backend for inference

Streamlit web application for interactive usage

Docker container for easy, all-in-one deployment (Streamlit + FastAPI)

The project focuses on length-controlled text generation, where the reward function encourages outputs close to a target length.

🔗 Live Demo (Streamlit App):

🧠 Key Concepts Used

GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)

A reinforcement learning method that compares multiple generated outputs per prompt and optimizes based on relative rewards.

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

Efficient fine-tuning by training only ~3.5% of the model parameters.

TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)

Used to implement GRPO training.

FastAPI

Production-ready inference API.

Streamlit

Lightweight frontend for real-time interaction.

Weights & Biases (W&B)

Experiment tracking and training visualization.

🚀 Deployment

1️⃣ Using Docker (Recommended)

The project can be run entirely using Docker—no need to manually install dependencies or run FastAPI/Streamlit separately.

Build the Docker image:

docker build -t grpo-smollm2 .

Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8501:8501 --name grpo-smollm2-container grpo-smollm2


2️⃣ FastAPI (Backend)

The FastAPI service:

Loads the fine-tuned model

Exposes a REST endpoint for text generation

Designed for easy integration with any frontend

Run locally:

uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

3️⃣ Streamlit (Frontend)

The Streamlit app:

Provides a simple UI for prompt input

Displays model responses in real time

Communicates with the FastAPI backend

Run locally:

streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py

🧪 Use Cases

Length-controlled summarization

RLHF / RLAIF research experiments

Lightweight LLM deployment demos

Educational projects for GRPO & TRL

🧑‍💻 Contributing

Contributions and issues are welcome!

Please fork the repository and create pull requests for improvements.

Note: For portfolio and demo purposes, the FastAPI backend is run within the Streamlit application process.

Future Improvements:

Separate backend deployment

Containerized FastAPI service

Authentication & rate limiting
